# Driver-Drowsiness-detection-System
With this Python project, we will be making a drowsiness detection system. A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy. The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.
The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
The dataset used for this model is created by us. To create the dataset, we wrote a script that captures eyes from a camera and stores in our local disk. We separated them into their respective labels ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The data was manually cleaned by removing the unwanted images which were not necessary for building the model. The data comprises around 7000 images of people’s eyes under different lighting conditions.
